            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PORTRAICTURE OF Roger L'Eſtrange Drawn to the LIFE.</head>
            <p>YOU may as well tell me, that the Moon is made of a Toſting-Fork; becauſe ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears ſometimes with two Horns—Believe what? —That ever <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> Eſquire, was at the Queens Chappel, ſince the Kings Reſtauration—Why, his Picture was taken there— His Picture taken there! that's impoſſible—For he goes always with a Hood over his Face—Why he is Pictured ſo—So that when ever you ſee a man pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with a Hood upon his Face, you may be ſure that's <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange,</hi> Eſquire. Some there are that picture him with two Faces, like <hi>Janus,</hi> the one looking
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:58664:3"/> toward the Proteſtant, the other toward the Popiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, with a wide Mouth; indeavouring, like <hi>Saturn,</hi> to devour the Evidence of the Popiſh Plot, and a <hi>Label,</hi> crying out, Oh! the <hi>Profuſeneſs of the Preſs;</hi> carrying in his Hand either a <hi>Dialogue,</hi> or a <hi>Letter to a Friend,</hi> or a <hi>Quotation</hi> of his own <hi>Pamphlets</hi> to make up the Price; and laſtly, an Attorney Sticking in the waſte of his Breeches, like an old faſhioned Pen and Ink-horn. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers picture him with a pair of Scates, ſliding out of harmes way, with a painted Coat upon his back, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Pedigree of his Gentility, ſupported by <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> and <hi>Oſtenta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Now for his Inſide, the Painters have found out a new way to dip their Pencils in Credible Teſtimony, and Authentick Depoſition; the Colours of which have that Property, that they are never to be defaced. So that if you ſhould ſee him painted in the Queens Chappel, in the Colours of theſe Depoſitions, a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years hence, you would almoſt ſwear him to be alive, and the very ſame man.</p>
            <p>Now for your better ſatisfaction, I'll give you a ſight of all theſe Depoſitions, which I perceive you have not not ſeen, though Printed already in their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Sheets. There's your <hi>

This Deponant ſaith, That a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three years ſince he ſaw Mr. <hi>Roger L'Eſtrange</hi> three or four times kneeling at Maſs, in the Queens Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel.</p>

                  <p>THis Examinant ſaith that about the middle, or toward the Latter end of the Month of <hi>June</hi> Laſt, Mr. <hi>L'Strange</hi> came to her houſe (her Husband being out of Town) and there accus'd her and her Husband for Printing and Publiſhing divers bookes, which he ſaid were very dangerous againſt the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, naming ſeveral Pamphlets which ſhe knew nothing of; and though ſhe truely did deny her ſelf concern'd in any ſuch thing, yet he perſiſted that he would prove it, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to threaten that it lay in his power to ruin her and her Husband, and then told her of his great Intereſt at Court, and that if ſhe would tell him, who ſet her on to publiſh ſuch books, he would take her off from all trouble, and promiſed to do great things for her Husband.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:58664:6"/> he makes a <hi>note</hi> upon the <hi>great abatement</hi> of my <hi>reckning?</hi> as being <hi>aſſured</hi> by report, that I had ſworn <hi>in the company of Care, Curtiſs</hi> and others, that I <hi>had ſeen him at Maſs, at leaſt, or about a hundred times.</hi>

            <p>As for what he was aſſur'd of by report, I va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue it not: neither is it material to the Poynt; as being of little or no force againſt him. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is between his <hi>Proteſtation,</hi> and my <hi>Oath.</hi> Which I have here confirmed by the Oath of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other Perſon, Mr. <hi>Mowbray</hi> by name, who likewiſe ſwears he ſaw him twice in the year 1677. at a <hi>Popiſh Chappel,</hi> that is to ſay at <hi>Somerſet-Houſe:</hi> To the great diſparagement of that part of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, <hi>never ſince the Kings Reſtauration,</hi> which was in the <hi>year,</hi> 1660. Now I would never have tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en notice of Mr. <hi>L' Strange</hi>'s ſolemn Declaration, had it been upon any other account but this, that either he has ſome particular reſerves to himſelf, or I muſt be perjur'd, and that ſhould he now go un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwered (which is a thing he boaſts of) the ſharp Twits which he has given the Kings Evidence would paſs for Currant, and he would come to be a quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Author againſt Us. And therefore I do as pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly and as ſolemnly declare as he has done, that I am as tender of Swearing to the detriment of my Neighbour as any other perſon that aimes at the Enjoyment of a future Happineſs. For my part I know not to what very great purpoſe the latter part of his Declaration was made. For having ſo ſolemnly declared himſelf of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> what if he had been ſeen twenty times at a Popiſh Chappel? But that part of his Poteſtation was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly level'd at my Oath, which I am oblig'd to uphold ſo farr as honeſtly I may. And that too
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:58664:6"/> without any reflection upon Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi>'s Honeſty or his Loyalty, fully believing neither to be inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with the Profeſſion of the Popiſh Religion.</p>
            <p>In his <hi>Caſe,</hi> where he talks to himſelf in his own Cauſe, under the Perſons of <hi>Zekiel</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> like one that playes at Tables with his right Hand againſt his left; <hi>Ephraim</hi> tells <hi>Zekiel,</hi> that he was <hi>rounded in the Ear, that</hi> Prance <hi>had Ten Witneſſes in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to prove that</hi> L'Eſtrange <hi>had been Forty times at Maſs here, and ſolemnly Worſhipping according to the Profeſſion of the Romiſh Communion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And thus I who made a Confeſſion ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marakble, and thereby diſcover'd that bloody deed of darkneſs, which enlighten'd the whole Nation, am here rendred as one that kept <hi>Witneſſes in readineſs,</hi> or rather, pickl'd Witneſſes for preſent uſe. By this means, in a ſhort time, the Murther of Sr. <hi>Edmon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury Godfrey,</hi> will be as little believ'd as the ſilly Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Mr. <hi>Powel.</hi> To which purpoſe Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi>'s Narrative of the Plot ſeems to have but odly Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pl'd that foul Fact, with the ridicule of Mr. <hi>Powel</hi>'s eſcape, which renders the Frame work very ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. For though it be true, that the <hi>diſparagement of a juggle, no way weakens the Truth;</hi> Yet there may be that manner of ſpeaking, and that Art made uſe of in the contexture of Words, that may overturn that Maxime. With ſubmiſſion to Mr. <hi>L'Estrange,</hi> there is in that place (<hi>Nar. P.</hi> 19.) ſuch a mixture of the meaneſt fourberies of <hi>Report,</hi> which the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable Circumſtance of the Diſcovery, that my ſlender Opinion is, that a more prudent Progreſſion in Logick ought to have ſupported the violent Death of Sir <hi>Edmunbury Godfrey.</hi> For if the Story of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:58664:7"/> 
               <hi>Choqueuz</hi> Fire-works, were never prov'd the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pition of <hi>Tukesbury</hi> Muſtard-Balls, was never yet ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted the greateſt Argument of the Plot. And if the buſineſs of Sir <hi>Henry Titchbourns</hi> Armes were not made out, the Surmiſe of the <hi>Black-Bills</hi> lies as much at the Mercy of any mans Belief, without any preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice to the Belief of the Plot; and thus Poſterity ſhall Argue from Circumſtances not much material, whether they are believed or no, the falſhood of the greateſt Diſcoveries of the Grand Plot that ever was made in the World. Eſpecially when Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> ſhall go about to convince the World of the falſhood and Perjury of the chief Evidence of his Murther. For my part, I much wonder why Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> ſhould ſo much trouble himſelf with his <hi>Schiſmatical-Plot.</hi> They who diſcovered the Popiſh-Plot, produced the Conſpirators, nam'd their Names, brought their Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence againſt them, and were the occaſion of Sentence and Execution. If Mr. <hi>L'ſtrange</hi> knew of any <hi>Schiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical</hi> or <hi>Phanatick</hi>-Plot, He ought to have done the ſame. Otherwiſe upon no other Grounds but the wandring Notions of unlicens'd Books, to cry out a <hi>Phanatick</hi>-Plot, is but juſt, as when they cry out <hi>Thieves</hi> at one end of the Houſe, and at the ſame time to cry out <hi>Thieves</hi> at the other end, and thereby to diſtract, and diſcompoſe the Defence of the whole.</p>
            <p>In the next place I obſerve, that when, in your Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, you have dignified Mr. <hi>Care</hi> with the meaneſt of Characters (though in ſome Sheets of Mr. <hi>Cares</hi> there are thoſe things produc'd, that will take up Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> a full year to Anſwer by way of Dialogue.</p>
            <p>You tell the World he wrote my Narrative. That is to ſay, my Narrative was a pittiful contemptible thing, and conſequently little to be credited. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs. in ſuch a Narrative as that, neither the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:58664:7"/> as I humbly conceive, nor the perſon that wrote it were ſo much to be regarded, as the Verity of the matter of Fact. And many people perhaps ſee with Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges</hi> Eyes, and out of a Reſpect to his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genuity, Judg with his Judgment. In which Reſpect I am a little induced to queſtion Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges</hi> ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by himſelf aſſerted difference and kindneſs to the Kings Evidence, for giving ſuch a publick Advertiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of my Narrative, after he had made the Writer ſo miſerably Ridiculous, he might have proſecuted his Revenge, without ſuch an unſeaſonable Reflection. But whoever aſſiſted as to the Form, the matter was mine, and publick Juſtice is ſatisfied.</p>
            <p>I come now to the <hi>Information</hi> of <hi>Jane Curtis,</hi> the ſubſtance of which is, That Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> ſpeaking of <hi>Oates and his Gang,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He did not queſtion but to ſee them all hang'd ere long,</hi> and that he refus'd to Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe 2 Books, Swearing he would not do it for 500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> which afterwards the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> Licenſed at firſt ſight.</p>
            <p>In the firſt place I muſt certainly conclude my ſelf to be comprehended in Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges</hi> kind wiſhes, as confeſſing my ſelf to be one of thoſe which he called of the <hi>Gang.</hi> As for the woman that ſwore the Oath the World has not been heard as yet to give her any other Character than of a Painful and Induſtrious Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, very much intruſted, and a fair Dealer: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhe have ſworn true or falſe, I will not undertake to determine, that is to her own Conſcience. But if ſhe have ſworn true, as there is little reaſon to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubt, where there is ſo little reaſon to ſurmiſe to the contrary. Then it is not his twitting her Husband with a <hi>Fooliſh trick he hath taken up of winding up his Noſe and ſhewing his Teeth,</hi> will free him from the heavy cenſures that will follow: But twas no wonder he fell ſo foul upon the Husband, when the Wife lay ſo heavy upon him.</p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:58664:8"/>
            <p>What will be thought of him, who in an <hi>Appeal to the Kings moſt excellent Majeſty, and the three Eſtates aſsembled in Parliament,</hi> had produced ſo many <hi>Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations</hi> from his own <hi>Writings</hi> to teſtifie the Eſteem and Honour he had for tht Kings Evidence? What will be thought of thoſe <hi>Quotations</hi> themſelves? and that particular <hi>Ejaculation</hi> to the Doctor, <hi>They are won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things, Doctor, which you have done, and I am perſwaded that you are reſerved for more wonderful things to come,</hi> but that they were only the Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Scorn and Deriſion? For Deriſion is many times as Complimental as Friendſhip it ſelf. And this is moſt certain, that he that wiſhes another man hang'd, can never have an eſteem for his Perſon. For my part until this Difference be decided, I muſt be convinced he has no kindneſs for me. And then the World muſt conclude him partial as to my concerns. And I will go a little farther to put it to the Vote among all thoſe of the true Church of <hi>England,</hi> how well it became the Charity of a declared Church of <hi>England</hi>-Man, to wiſh <hi>Oats and all his Gang</hi> in the Hangman's Nooze? And it may be queſtion'd, whether ſuch a one be what he affirms himſelf to be, let him proteſt never ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p>As for the latter part of this Information, I will not undertake to be a Compitent Judg of Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi>'s Learning, or whether it be ſuperiour to that of any one of the Lord Biſhop of <hi>London</hi>'s Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lains; but me thinks it ſeems a little od to my weak Judgment, that there ſhould be ſuch a vaſt difference in the Opinions of two ſuch Eminent men of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> and the Biſhops Chaplain, that the one ſhould refuſe, and ſwear <hi>by his Maker,</hi> he would not Licence a couple of Sheets, no, not for five hundred pounds (a good ſmiling Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation) which the other did <hi>Gratis,</hi> at the firſt ſight.
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:58664:8"/> And yet we have as little Reaſon to queſtion the Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty and Integrity of my Lord Biſhop of <hi>Londons</hi> Chaplains, as we have to queſtion Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges.</hi> So that it follows, that it muſt be either a very great weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or overſight, either in the one or the other. Now you'l ſay, what were the Titles, or what the Subjects of thoſe two Sheets. The one was, <hi>The Character of a Turbulent Pragmatical Jeſuite, and Factious Romiſh Prieſt.</hi> Epitomizing their Continual Diſturbancies of Church and State, and particularly giving an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Death of the Emperor <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th, who was Murdered by one <hi>Bernardine,</hi> a predicant Fryer, that gave him Poyſon in the Holy <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed, <hi>Oct.</hi> 15. 1678. The other, <hi>A Letter from a Catholick Gentleman to his Popiſh Friends,</hi> then <hi>to be exil'd from London.</hi> Ironically adviſing them to obey their Ghoſtly Fathers, and not the King; and thereby taking an occaſion to ſhew how little the Papiſts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded <hi>Teſts</hi> or <hi>Oaths,</hi> to whom a Diſpenſation from the Pope was always an <hi>Infallible help at Maw,</hi> againſt <hi>Perjurie.</hi> Licenſed, 1678.</p>
            <p>Theſe were the two ſcare-Crowes that ſo terrified Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange,</hi> and which were of ſuch dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to the Government, and the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> that he would not Licenſe them for 500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> And yet it is apparent, they were Licenſed, and by thoſe who were as Chary of offending the Government, or the Church of <hi>England</hi> as he could be. It were almoſt madneſs to think that thoſe Reverend Gentlemen who were entruſted with the Licenſing of Books, at <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth</hi> or <hi>London</hi>-Houſe, ſhould be ſo inconſiderate, or ſo unfaithful to let go or connive at any thing preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial to the Church and State. Unleſs there be any that think the Art and Judgment of Licenſing ſuch a Miſtery, that only Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> has obtained it by long Practice. But there may be ſomething in the Caſe
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:58664:9"/> indeed: For theſe wonderful Gentlemen, <hi>Dick</hi> and <hi>Tom, Ci<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t</hi> and <hi>Bumpkin, Zekiel</hi> and <hi>Ephraim, Philo-L'Eſtrange</hi> and <hi>Pragmatieus,</hi> may be the wiſeſt men in the World, and of Mr. <hi>L'Eſtranges</hi> Privy-Council for ought I know, and he himſelf may have the Spirit of Licenſing, and a diſcerning Faculty above all the World beſide, for any thing I can contradict him. All that I have to ſay is, that I ſtand ſtill in my own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, and have only brought theſe Circumſtances to make it out, that if I did ſee a Man at Maſs, there might be probably ſome other Reaſon for it then Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity.</p>
            <p>The next is the Information of <hi>Joſeph Bennet,</hi> that Mr. <hi>L'ſtrange</hi> importun'd him to Bayl Captain <hi>Eli</hi> at the Council-Board. What harm in all this? None at all that I know. 'Twas the part of a Gentleman and a Friend to take care of his Friend in Adverſity. But we are ſtill to conſider the circumſtances. Captain <hi>Eli</hi> it ſeems was in the ſame accuſation with himſelf, but this argues that Mr. L'<hi>ſtrange</hi> knew the perſon well and was acquainted with his Crime. However you'l ſay, Mr. L'<hi>Eſtrange</hi> was happily acquitted, and I am exceedingly glad of it. Nevertheleſs I ſay again, Mr. L'<hi>Eſtrange</hi> did know the perſon, &amp; was acquainted with his Offence, and perhaps he judged it ſlight and trivial, or elſe he did ill to engage his Friend. But this Captain <hi>Eli</hi> was a Conſpirator with himſelf, deeply engaged; a perſon that he knew to be concerned with him, a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that had paid <hi>Tongue</hi> ſeveral ſums of money to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the carrying on the Deſign, and therefore it became him as a Gentleman to procure Bail for his fellow Conjurator: Let him make a Dialogue to clear himſelf of this, and then for Papiſt or no Papiſt, when he pleaſes he ſhall have more of it; in the mean time, the World is to conſider upon what account this <hi>Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davit</hi> is produced.</p>
            <pb n="15" facs="tcp:58664:9"/>
            <p>There is yet behind the Examination of Mr. <hi>Richard Fletcher,</hi> who ſwears, that after ſome diſcourſe, Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> declar'd himſelf to him, <hi>to be a Catholick of Rome, and to believe the Faith of that Church,</hi> and that being ask'd <hi>whether the Pope were the head of that Church He anſwered he was; and he hoped ere long, many others would turn to that Church, or to that effect.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the perſon that ſwears, he is well known both in City and Country, a perſon that lives handſomely &amp; gentielely, and a great lover of that noble Science to which Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> cannot be thought to bear any Spleen, though for his excellency in performance he has been too unkindly reproach'd; ſo that the world does hardly believe that Mr. <hi>Fletcher,</hi> a perſon by his Indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſo well guarded from Neceſſity, would make ſuch a Diſcord in Human Society, as to ſwear though it were for 500 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> to the prejudice of the leaſt Hair of Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrang</hi>'s head. Now then the Queſtion is, which the unbyaſſed are to believe? <hi>Dick</hi> or <hi>Tom, Zekiel</hi> or <hi>Ephraim, Citt</hi> or <hi>Bumkin, Philo-L'Eſtrange,</hi> or <hi>Pragma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticus,</hi> or Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> himſelf, with his own Lips de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring himſelf to be a <hi>Catholick of Rome, and to believe the Faith of that Church?</hi> If Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> has chang'd his mind ſince he made this Declaration, there's no more to be ſaid, I'le yield my <hi>Affidavit</hi> loſt; if not, 'tis a Riddle to me, unleſs he mean ſuch a Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> Man, as in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the 7th or <hi>Queen Mary.</hi> He declares one thing, and proteſts another. How to judg is a hard Caſe, and yet me thinks there is but little Reaſon, that he who will not believe himſelf, ſhould be believ'd by others. What is it to me, whe- Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> be a Papiſt or no? And yet I cannot conceive it to be ſuch an irrefragable Argument, that a man is no Papiſt becauſe he rattles the <hi>Phanaticks,</hi> and exclaims with ſo much bitterneſs againſt the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious Liberty of the Preſs. He is the moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:58664:10"/> perſon in the World to combat the freedom of Scribling, or at leaſt to purſue that Subject with ſo much virulence and bitterneſs of Spirit. For all the world will judg that to be Self-Intereſt in him, which would be thought real Sentiment in another. On the other ſide nothing more prevails with me to believe the Gentleman is no Papiſt, becauſe I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that any perſon of true Learning and Ingenuity would be of ſuch a Mock ſhow, Gewgaw, Joynted-Baby Religion, that puts Divine worſhip to hold <hi>de la quenoville,</hi> and would inforce us to deifie the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, with as many Titles of Honour in her Liturgie, as ever the Queen of <hi>Spain</hi> had. But if ſelf-Intereſt happen to dazle the Sight, or the Proſpect of prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment better improve a mans judgment, I have nothing more to ſay.</p>
            <p>But what is it to me, whether Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> be a Papiſt or no? My deſign is only to maintain the Truth of my Information. I have ſworn that I did ſee Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> at Maſs in the Queens Chappel ſince his Majeſties happy Reſtauration, 1660 And that I will juſtify, though he reſume a Proteſtation as long as from <hi>Charing-Croſs</hi> to <hi>Milend-Green.</hi> For if he will not believe his own Lips, I muſt and will believe my own Eyes. He ſays indeed, <hi>I could not ſay I ſaw him Receive.</hi> 'Tis very right; for I ſaw no ſuch thing; and therefore becauſe I ſwore no more then I ſaw, 'tis the fairer Argument that what I ſwore was the Truth. But what ſays <hi>Ephraim</hi> my Beloved? Why <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſays, that I ſhould ſay, that I would ſwear I had ſeen him forty times at Maſs. But you ſee, my Beloved, that <hi>Ephraim</hi> was unkind in his Report, He was a falſe Brother, and ſtrayed from the Truth.</p>
            <pb n="17" facs="tcp:58664:10"/>
            <p>But what if <hi>Ephraim</hi> had heard it? 'twas onely a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and no more than what Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> himſelf tells the world in his <hi>Appeal,</hi> onely that the Number differs; <hi>viz.</hi> That I ſhould ſay in company, That I would ſwear I had <hi>ſeen</hi> Him at Maſs <hi>above a hundred times.</hi> By which, the world may ſee, that Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> was more <hi>Afraid</hi> than <hi>Hurt.</hi> But I would fain know what 'tis to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, what <hi>Ephraim</hi> reports, or what he by his Eeves-droppers is aſſured of, when the Oath it ſelf appears, and puts all Reports and Hear ſays out of doors. Why then to unfold the Myſtery, they were only <hi>Attaques</hi> of <hi>Diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement;</hi> one of the moſt prudent waies in the world to undermine and blow up a Teſtimony. To which purpoſe <hi>Ephraim</hi> the Cunning layes another Train, and tells <hi>Zekiel</hi> the Suttle, that he was <hi>rounded in the Ear,</hi> that I had <hi>Ten Witneſſes in a readineſs,</hi> to make good my proof. A Reproach, which wherever it takes faſt hold, ſpreads it ſelf, and eats into the Reputation of a <hi>Teſtimony,</hi> like Oil of Spike ſpilt upon Deal Boards. This <hi>Ephraim</hi> I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, was like all the reſt of the world; nothing refin'd by his Baptiſm; eaſie to believe any thing that made for his Advantage. But now who can blame <hi>Harris</hi> or <hi>Gay</hi> for writing and publiſhing ridiculous Fables, when the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that finds fault, ſhall publiſh, upon <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s being barely Rounded in the Ear, ſuch trivial ſtuff as this, which onely denotes the want of better Defence. For I would know, if Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> were to be try'd upon the ſingle Iſſue, <hi>ſeen at Maſs, or not ſeen at Maſs,</hi> and I ſhould come and ſwear, as I do, that I had ſeen him at Maſs ſo many times, whether <hi>Reports</hi> and <hi>Hear-ſayes,</hi> and <hi>Round<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in the Ear,</hi> that I would ſwear this or that which I did not hear, would acquit him? For if <hi>I thinks,</hi> and <hi>as I remembers,</hi> and <hi>as I believes,</hi> will not be admitted into an Oath, which muſt be abſolute, as mine is, certainly <hi>Hear-ſayes,</hi> and <hi>Reports,</hi> and <hi>Roundings in the Ear,</hi> will be as little admitted in the Defence. So that in my Opinion
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:58664:11"/> 
               <hi>Ephraim</hi>'s Intelligence was not at that time worth the Coffee he gave for it, though it were but one Diſh.</p>
            <p>But now <hi>Ephraim</hi> comes to the particulars of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and ſayes, <hi>Ten in number;</hi> pray Gentlemen give me leave to conſider a little. Well, I have done it, and I muſt faithfully declare to the world, that I do not know of any <hi>Store Ponds</hi> that I have for any ſuch ſort of Fiſh. If <hi>Ephraim</hi> know of any, he ſhould do well to make the diſcovery. For I know it would be no ſmall ſatisfaction to him to ſee me incur the penalty of ſuch a breach of the Law. Truly there is no great probability of the Truth of the Report, becauſe the Story it ſelf does not hold wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For, for me to have ſo many Witneſſes <hi>in a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs,</hi> and not to make uſe of one, was a ſtrange piece of remiſneſs, to be ſo careleſs of a certain Victory. Upon the whole, whether Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> be a Papiſt or no, I will not determine; but theſe are excellent <hi>Hints</hi> for the Papiſts to lay hold on; and then to quote a Church-man of <hi>England</hi> for their Author. But 'tis well, all is not Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel that <hi>Zekiel</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> ſay. I do find they ſuffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the frailty of Fallibility, as well as others. For, as for Mr. <hi>Mowbray,</hi> he came in voluntarily, and gave in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation without my knowledge, and conſequently could be none of my number; and there was no more that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the buſineſs, eſpecially wherein I was concern'd. So that the <hi>Ten</hi> being hitherto inviſible, unleſs Mr. <hi>Ephraim</hi> can bring them to light, the Report and the Uſe made of it muſt be both equally inſignificant.</p>
            <p>But there are other Obſervations to be made; For if a Writer do poſitively aver that for Truth, which carries another face, 'tis ſhrewdly ſuſpicious he may make the ſame forfeiture in more circumſtances than one.</p>
            <p>Thus Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> in his <hi>Diſcovery upon Diſcovery,</hi> p. 13.
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:58664:11"/> 
               <hi>Now,</hi> Doctor, <hi>ſaith He, I do poſitively aver, that there was not one</hi> Church of England-man <hi>in the Parliament Army,</hi> as they call'd it. When it is a thing yet freſh in memory, that the Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> that very Metropolitan, upon whom <hi>Cleveland</hi> begins his Satyrical Elegy,
<q>
                  <l>Here <hi>York</hi>'s great Metropolitan is laid,</l>
                  <l>Who God's Anointed, and his Church betray'd.</l>
               </q> Serv'd in the Parliament Army, as it was then call'd, with a Command of Horſe. Now whether an Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> and one of the Metropolitans of the Kingdom, would have been advanced at that Time, to that Dignity, unleſs he had been a <hi>Church of England-man;</hi> that's the ſcruple. However, we may ſay thus much, that he ceas'd no more to be Archbiſhop of <hi>York,</hi> by ſiding with the Parliament, than <hi>Julius</hi> the Second ceas'd Pope by Joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the <hi>Turks.</hi> And therefore <hi>Cleveland</hi> allows him his Dignity after his Death, though he embalm it indeed with <hi>Aſſafaetida</hi> inſtead of <hi>Olibanum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now for any man to be ſo poſitive in the aſſertion of a thing, ſo notoriouſly ſubject to contradiction, will give a ſhrewd ſhog to the former value that was put upon the Writings of the ſame Perſon.</p>
            <p>Thus Mr. L'<hi>Eſtrange</hi> was pleas'd to diſown at the Council-Board that ever he knew me: And yet before that, at a certain Coffee-Houſe in <hi>Ludgate-ſtreet,</hi> he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vaniſh'd up ſtairs with great diſdain, upon my firſt appearance in the lower Room, murmuring out theſe words, <hi>The Devil ſets his Imps at work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe things I ſhould have been far from taking notice of, had it not been to ſupport my own juſtification, verily believing that the world would blame me much, and that
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:58664:12"/> the publick Enemy would get no ſmall advantage thereby, ſhould I have ſuffered my ſelf to be ſo paſſively negligent, as to ſee my ſelf run down with the quips and taunts of a quaint and fluent Pen, without a juſt vindication. In a word, I have only Sworn that I ſaw him at Maſs; here are other Informations, by which you muſt judge upon what account. I have no more to ſay to that particular.</p>
            <p>Now after all this, and a long ſilence, he is riſen again, and as I ſuppoſe, forgetting what he declared at the <hi>Half-Moon,</hi> renews the Old Lurrey of no <hi>Papiſt,</hi> nor <hi>Jeſuit</hi> in a Dialogue between <hi>Philo L'Eſtrange &amp; Pragmaticus.</hi> And Heaven, I ſay, prolong his Life, and may <hi>L'Eſtrange no Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt nor Jeſuit</hi> be the perpetual Theam, that he may ſatisfy his Humour, and write as many Dialogues as ever <hi>Lucian</hi> did. But I am very much afraid that a volume of Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues as big as the Book of Martyrs will do him but little good. For he goes about to bury the <hi>Subject</hi> itſelf under the heaps of his own Quires, it being moſt certain that men at length will grow tir'd with reading his needleſs Apolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies. For they that think him a Church-man of <hi>England,</hi> will believe him ſtill ſo to be, notwithſtanding all the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours of Accuſation. And as for thoſe that believe him a Papiſt, he may perhaps in time waſh a Blackamore white, but will never by that ſort of Rhetorick which he uſes be perſwaded to change their opinions. He has ſo <hi>be plotted</hi> the Generality of diſſenters under the odious Name of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naticks, that he muſt not expect any mercy of belief from them. They not being a ſort of people to be gained by Similes and bare Flouriſhes of Elocution, it being then to be preſumed, as he may eaſily perceive it himſelf, if he pleaſes, that they believe not one tittle of what he ſays, it follows that he only writes to them that believe him already, which is a labour altogether needleſs. And then again, whatever belief he may pretend to have of the Plot, yet in all his diſcourſes he ſpeaks ſo ambiguouſly of it, gives ſuch
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:58664:12"/> Complemental Reproaches to the Kings Evidence; that even blindneſs it ſelf may diſcover his aim; and that whatever his publick pretence may be, the ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of the Diſcovery and private Encouragement ſet the Wheels of his Invention a going. Worſe than the Blind Mill-Horſe, not underſtanding that he is labouring and grinding all the while for the grand Enemies of his King, and Country: Or elſe worſe than all theſe, who, knowing what he is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, purſues the Tracks of ſecret Treaſon and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy; rather than <hi>Coleman</hi> ſhall want a Succeſſour to his Secretariſhip, Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> will be the Perſon, ſo bewitching a Charm it is to ſome men to be the Inſtruments of Greatneſs; though in Evil En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes: But Mr. <hi>L'Eſtrange</hi> is old, and believing he has not long to live; what cares he what becomes of his Country after he is gone, ſo he may en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Sweets of this World, during his time. But men of theſe brave deſires, and Hunters after ill obtain'd Proſperity, forget thoſe wiſe ſayings of the very Heathens themſelves, That they who will not give credit to them that ſwear the truth, to the ſtifling of which ſo much labour has been uſed in vain, are themſelves the Contemners of Heaven, and guilty of thoſe Perjuries, which they would faſten upon others. And let the ſubtilty of the Devil pretend what it will, it is not to be imagin'd, that any but Papiſts, or their well-wiſhers, could be ſo ſtupidly obſtinate, as to run Counter to all thoſe ſignall Acts of Providence, that dayly brings to light the buſie Contrivances of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms Enemies. This however is our Comfort, that we ſeldom ſee the end of them, who by ſuch Inſtincts of private Intereſt oppoſe Heaven, and the peace of ſetled Government; but that in the Concluſion Divine Vengeance finds them out,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:58664:13"/> and brings them to ſhame and puniſhment. It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generally obſerved, that they who are moſt active to ſerve and aſſiſt a Conſpiracy, are the firſt laid aſide, upon the ſucceſs of the Deſign. A motive that ſhould induce the vain Aſpirer to a more conſiderate Conduct of his Actions.</p>
